## OBS Studio
Details on my linux setup for OBS Studio

### Install Source
Flatpak version seems to work the best

### Plugins
With Flatpak, plugin location is `~/.var/app/com.obsproject.Studio/config/obs-studio/plugins/`

- [obs-source-record](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-record.1285/)
  1. Go to Downloads and download the linux zip
  2. Open the zip and extract the latest zip
  3. Copy the extracted folder to plugins
